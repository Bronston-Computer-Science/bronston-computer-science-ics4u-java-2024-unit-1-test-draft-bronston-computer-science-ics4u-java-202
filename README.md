# Follow these instructions:

## Modify the `Main.java` file to:

-  Ask the user to enter the total number of students in a class (maximum 10).
   -  Using an `if-else` statement, ensure the total number of students inputted is less than 5 or greater than 10.
-  Using a loop, ask the user to input each studentâ€™s score (as integers between 0 and 100).
   -  Using an `if-else` statement, ensure each score inputted is greater than 0 and not greater than 100.
-  Store each student's score in an array.
-  Calculate and print:
   -  The average score of the class.
   -  The highest and lowest scores.
-  Using an `if-else` statement, determine if each student passed or failed and print out each outcome. A score of 50 or above is a pass; below 50 is a fail.

Your program output should look like this:
Student 1: Score = 78 (Pass)  
Student 2: Score = 45 (Fail)
...
Student 10: Score = 32 (Fail)  
Average Score = 62  
Highest Score = 92  
Lowest Score = 45
